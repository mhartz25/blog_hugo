And since most SQL errors occur even when the code compiles, it can be hard to know where to start when attempting to debug. Moreover, it&amp;rsquo;s not always possible to have a strong instinct on whether or not the returned data is correct, making it all the more crucial to have a process for debugging and double checking your query
Writing SQL is a huge part of my job, and I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly developed a checklist for my debugging to help me step through my code in the quickest way.</description></item><item><title>Analyzing Data Part 1</title><link>https://mhartz25.github.io/blog_hugo/posts/data_part1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mhartz25.github.io/blog_hugo/posts/data_part1/</guid><description>This is part one in hopefully a, multipart, blog series I’m working on titled How to Analyze Data, where the goal is to give people the foundational knowledge and tools necessary to start thinking about data critically. Every single person reading this looks at data in some form throughout every day of their lives. In most cases it’s very trivial or inconsequential. Sometimes it’s both. But one area we can all use help on is in times when things aren’t trivial and things aren’t inconsequential.</description></item><item><title>Nominal Mastery</title><link>https://mhartz25.github.io/blog_hugo/posts/nominal_mastery/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mhartz25.github.io/blog_hugo/posts/nominal_mastery/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://mhartz25.github.io/blog_hugo/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mhartz25.github.io/blog_hugo/about/</guid><description>Hi, welcome to my personal site. My plan is to use this site in somewhat random ways. Sometime there will be content related to Data, sometimes it might be some hypothesis I have about the world, or any other thing that might interest me enough to write about. This site will probably stay pretty barebones outside of the written content.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve somehow found this website and we haven&amp;rsquo;t met here&amp;rsquo;s some quick information:</description></item></channel></rss>
