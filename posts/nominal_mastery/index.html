I define it as being good enough at a particular skill to be considered reasonably better than the average person, but not necessarily being good enough at that skill for it to be your profession. As inconsequential as that sounds, it has become quite foundational to who I am[2]. Becoming a Nominal Master in as many things as possible.</p><p>It might be easiest to start by saying what Nominal Mastery is not. It is not being an Intermediate, nor is it the Slope of Enlightenment that you’ll see on a Dunning-Kruger curve. To me both of those are steps along a development curve where someone is trying to climb as high as they can get. Either of those classifications inherently signal that someone has more progress left to make. Nominal Mastery is more of an end goal. Another thing Nominal Mastery doesn’t work for is for whatever skills pertain to their career of choice. This is why in my definition of Nominal Mastery was the fact that it’s a skill level in which you can’t make a profession out of it. I limit the use of Nominal Mastery as a goal for hobbies or side projects.</p><p>Nominal Mastery is not about having the insiders view of where you stand on the distribution curve of a particular skill. Instead it’s more about what an outsider might think of you. I will never be a chef in a Michelin star restaurant, but I can make a decent smashburger and reverse-sear a steak, so in the eyes of my roommate I’m a great chef. It’s not about what Gordon Ramsey will think of my skills, it’s about what the random people who I meet in my life will think.</p><p>Being a Nominal Master means that you can throw a dart in public knowing that there’s a pretty good chance you know more than the person it hits – contingent that you aren’t at a convention for whatever skill you’re testing against.</p><p>Make no mistake, just because I’m using an outsider&rsquo;s eye to judge whether or not I’ve reached a certain level of proficiency, does not mean this concept relies on the validation of some faceless population. It’s more to say that there’s many things that look impressive on the surface to an outsider, but to an insider it is trivial. Think of it like a magician doing card tricks. When you don’t know how the trick is done, you’re going to be impressed by it. The magician can feel good about the awed reactions they are receiving for their sleight of hand. But if the magician instead does their routine for a group of magicians, their tricks no longer garner the same reaction. The skill level is in the eye of the beholder. By retaining that outside view, we can allow ourselves to be satisfied with where we stand while having the added benefit of learning more… and the adulation of your peers doesn’t hurt either</p><p>Part of the reason I exclude skills related to one’s career or other passions from Nominal Mastery is due to the amount commitment growing in those domains takes. As you spend more time on a skill it gets increasingly harder to improve[3]. Climbing up that hill of diminishing returns should only be reserved for those things in which you are most passionate. If you told me I could never juggle again I wouldn’t care in the slightest. If you told me I had to leave my career in Data I would definitely drag my feet, but ultimately I could probably find something else that I enjoy. But if you told me that I could never learn anything new – that I’m restricted to everything I already know and have experienced so far in my life – then I would rather not live. Maybe that’s dramatic, but I cannot think of a life more of a bore than one that does not have any [word for something new]</p><p>In the book Flow – which you should definitely read – the author makes a point about how attractive it is to be an amateur or a dilettante at something, so long as you aren’t an asshole about it.</p><p>My take: Learn. Learn as much as you can. Nothing in this life is too trivial that it’s not worth spending some time with. Whether you decide to go as deep as possible in a few things or just touch on many things, is your decision. But the only thing I won’t accept is an absence of learning</p><p>If you made it this far into the post I’d love to hear from you.
